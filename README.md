**MAKE SURE YOU ARE RUNNING MACOS.** This script will not work in Linux or Windows.

## How to download
---

MacOS is dumb and doesn't come with Git by default

## How to install
---

Open up a terminal and cd to the `install-motd-macos` directory. If you don't know what I'm talking about, you probably don't need this script because you probably don't use the terminal, like, at all.

Once you get there, run `chmod +x install-motd-macos.sh edit-profile.sh` to make the two scripts executable.

After that, run `./install-motd-macos.sh` and follow all the prompts. This script will install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and Neofetch, then write a few lines to `/etc/profile`. It won't break anything, unless you run it more than once. **DO NOT RUN THIS SCRIPT MORE THAN ONCE.** You'll wind up with multiple of the same thing printing itself out when you log in.
