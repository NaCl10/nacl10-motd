Okay. Give me a minute and I'll explain why this repo is looking rather half-finished.

I created this mostly so that a couple of friends of mine who use Macs and don't use the terminal much could install this MOTD, which they might want to do. 

Right now, I've been spending most of the day every day working on a website. I'm learning as I go, so it's kind of slow going, but it's kind of my top priority at the moment. 

**TL;DR I'll finish this repo/project in a month or two**
