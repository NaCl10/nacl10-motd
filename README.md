~~Okay. Give me a minute and I'll explain why this repo is looking rather half-finished.~~

~~I created this mostly so that a couple of friends of mine who use Macs and don't use the terminal much could install this MOTD, which they might want to do.~~

~~Right now, I've been spending most of the day every day working on a website. I'm learning as I go, so it's kind of slow going, but it's kind of my top priority at the moment.~~

~~**TL;DR I'll finish this repo/project in a month or two**~~

screw all that. this is a really stupid repo. if you can't figure out how to edit your .profile, you shouldn't use a motd anyway. this is no longer supported.

Another thing: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH WHY DID GITHUB PUT THIS IN THE ARCTIC CODE VAULT? NOW MY TERRIBLE CODE IS ARCHIVED FOREVER!!!!!1!!!!11!!
